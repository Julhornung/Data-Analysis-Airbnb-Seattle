## Installation
The .ipynb file can be used with jupyter notebooks. Please see here(https://jupyter.org/install) for installation details. 

## Project Motivation
To pass the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree program, several projects have to be passed. The first project called "Write a Data Science Blogposts" is used to teach an exemplary workflow in Data Science projects. At first relevant business questions have to be stated that will subsequently be examined with the help of Data Science techniques. When these questions have been answered for the Data Scientist him/herself the work is however not finished. Next it comes to present the results and the process how these results where achieved to different audiences. These two audiences can largely differ in their backgrounds and can usually be devided into people with a technical background and "business people" that should ideally act based on your recommendations/findings. In order to make your work and effort most effective both audiences have to be convinced of the quality and the impact of your work. So it is most important to adress these different audiences separately and with different methods. 
This GitHub repository is therefore used to adress a more technical audience whereas the respective blog post adresses the more general/business oriented audience. 
The Jupyter Notebook also adresses the business-related questions and tries to convince the technical reader about the quality of the work by showing off all the code that produced the results.
In general this notebook follows the guidelines of the CRISP-DM process(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining).

## Questions and important findings
1.) "What are the most common property types offered in Seattle and how much do they cost?
 The most common offerings are houses and appartments with a mean cost of 133 and 123 $ per night respectively.

2.) "How do the prices for apartments in Seattle develop during one year?"
It can be clearly seen from the data that there is a seasonal trend in apartment prices. Especially during summer and partly around Christmas, an increase in the nightly      aparment prices is apparent. Furthermore, the nights from Friday to Saturday and from Saturday to Sunday are more expensive then the weekday prices. 

3.) "How do the prices for apartments in different quarters develop during one year?"
For four central quarters, the seasonal price development was investigated in more detail. It was found that for the Downton district the seasonal price increase was most pronounced. The Central Area district on the other hand does not show a seasonal price dependence. For all investigated districts, the weekend prices were found to be higher than the weekday prices.
